# Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System

 Project Overview:
This project builds a restaurant recommendation system using Swiggy restaurant data.  
Recommendations are generated based on restaurant similarity using clustering and similarity measures, and results are displayed through a Streamlit web application.

The dataset contains restaurant-level information with the following key features:
- City
- Cuisine
- Rating
- Rating Count
- Cost etc



 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:( recomm.ipynb)
The raw dataset was inspected and cleaned using Pandas. The following steps were performed:

- Inspected dataset structure and data types
- Checked for missing values and duplicate records
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Selected relevant numerical and categorical features
- Created two datasets:
  - **`swigy_CLEANED.csv`**: Cleaned dataset with original readable features
  - **`preprocessed_data.csv`**: Fully numerical dataset used for clustering and recommendations and saved this preprocessed data in pickle 


Recommendation Methodology:(recommendation.py)
- K-Means clustering was applied to group similar restaurants
- Restaurants within the same cluster are considered similar
- Recommendations are generated by selecting top restaurants from the same cluster
- Ranking is based on rating and rating count
- Cosine similarity is used where applicable for similarity computation.. in the terminal run python recommendation.py

## Streamlit Application
The Streamlit app provides:
- User input controls (rating, cost, restaurant index)
- Real-time restaurant recommendations
- Tabular display of recommended restaurants.

 How to Run

In the terminal entre, streamlit run st.py

finally:
This project implements a Swiggy restaurant recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The first file performs data cleaning and preprocessing, where the raw dataset is inspected, cleaned, and saved as two outputs: a cleaned CSV file and a fully numerical preprocessed dataset stored using Pickle. The second file applies K-Means clustering on the preprocessed data and generates restaurant recommendations based on cluster similarity and ranking metrics. The final file is a Streamlit application that takes user input and displays recommended restaurants through an interactive web interface. This setup ensures a clear separation between data preparation, model logic, and user interaction.
